# `directorycleanup`

To get started, consider any folder that has a mix of file types that you'd like to sort.

`directorycleanup` will create a folder for each file type in the current direcotry, and it will collect every file of a given type, and add it to a folder with a name matching the file extension.

e.g.

`image1.jpg` will be moved to a folder named `jpg`

Please enjoy and let me know if you have any issues.
